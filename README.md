# k_particles
OHBM 2023 Brainhack project.

For now there are several scripts under `k_particles` folder. Maybe, one way of organizing could be that everyone works on independent scripts (as opposed to trying to build e.g. a library of functions) for now.

However, notice that there is a `core.py` file inside the `k_particles` folder, where I was putting some general use functions that I have been commonly using.


# Used libraries 
I am using the libraries/programs below, but we are not limited to them. However, I would prefer to keep the number of dependencies at minimum in the long run.
### Python
- numpy
- scipy
- nibabel

### Video compilation
- ffmpeg
